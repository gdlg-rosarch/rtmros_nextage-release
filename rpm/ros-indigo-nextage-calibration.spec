%description
This package provides .launch files and other tools for calibrating the head-
mount cameras to the NEXTAGE Open robot. As of version 0.7.15/March 2017, only
Kinect/Xtion is capable (i.e. Ueye cameras, the ones the robot comes with on
this head by default, are not yet handled).

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
